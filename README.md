# Evolutionary-Search-Strategies
Evolutionary search based optimization strategies for function minimization. Can be used for continuous function optimization. Well suited for teaching, benchmarking etc.

1. Available solvers

  Currently, the package contains the following solvers:
  
    1. RCGA (Real-coded genetic algorithm)
    
2. Descriptions of the strategies
 
 2.1. RCGA
 
The RCGA implements the real-coded genetic algorithm. The package uses numpy to provide simple data structures. The RCGA makes use of Arithmetic crossover and MÃ¤kinen-Periaux-Toivonen mutation strategies. The mutation probability is updated deterministically within generations.
